The simplest way to explain this project is that I wanted to learn how TCP and Socket protocol works.
I also never made a python script past a single file before, mostly because I never dove really far into python scripting,
because I prioritized learning C++ for robotics. Now that I am in university and can finally set that aside for a little bit,
I decided to start this project (after realizing my experience in this field was rather lacking).

Enough about me, heres how the program works.

(description to be added later once the project is complete)
